# Advanced Lab Data-Analysis Curriculum

This is a lesson plan for few weeks of advanced physics data-analysis coursework which will replace hands-on labwork during the coronavirus-impacted weeks of Physics 302/318.

## Technology setup

The format of typical class meetings will be:

* 1:00 to 1:30 discussion of the day's analysis topic.
    * I will push new content (info, code) to this GitHub repository
    * We will talk about it on a Zoom call
* 1:30 to 4:30 analysis-code-a-thon
    * We will create a class Slack instance and use text chat during the code-a-thon.  Watch your email for the link.
	* I have created a private Github repo, https://github.com/bmonreal/adv_lab_student_work, into which you can commit your own code and images.  
    * For team/pairs coding, I will show you how to use the shared Jupyter-notebook feature of https://colab.research.google.com/
* 4:30 to 5:00 results and group discussion
    * Make sure you've checked something into Github
    * I'll check out a few different branches and we'll talk about the output plots together.

## Intro to Git and course tech
See [tech_intro/](tech_info/) for an introductory explanation of Git and Github, where we'll be sharing and discussing code and plots.

## Topics

### 1: Means, measurements, and errors (Tues, Mar 24)
Please go to [means_and_mmts/](means_and_mmts/) 

### 2: Understanding chi-squared statistics (Thurs, Mar 26)
Please go to [understanding_chi2/](understanding_chi2/)

### 3: Exponentials, power laws, and some real cosmic ray data (Tues, Mar 31 and Thurs, Apr 2)
Please go to [cosmic_rays/](cosmic_rays/)

### 4: Classical error propagation, but numerically (Thurs, Apr 4)

### 5: Pitfalls: examples of biased analysis procedures
