# Advanced Lab Data-Analysis Curriculum

## technology setup

The format of typical class meetings will be:

* 1:00 to 1:30 discussion of the day's analysis topic.
    * I will push new content (info, code) to a GitHub repository
    * We will talk about it on a Zoom call
* 1:30 to 4:30 analysis-code-a-thon
    * We will create a class Slack instance and use text chat during the code-a-thon.
    * You can pull/checkout out the new content from Github.
    * I think the best approach is "make your own analysis file AND your own branch", since we are not trying to collaborate on a single version of any software in any ordinary sense
    * For solo coding, go at it on your own laptop and push commits back to Github occasionally.  This will allow me to see your code and discuss it with you.
    * For team/pairs coding, I will show you how to use the shared Jupyter-notebook feature of https://colab.research.google.com/
* 4:30 to 5:00 results and group discussion
    * Make sure you've checked something into Github
    * I'll check out a few different branches and we'll talk about the output plots together.
