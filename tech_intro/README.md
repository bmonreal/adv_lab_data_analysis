# Technology for this course

## Git  and Github
The main new thing we will do technologically is this: I want to be able to look at your code and plots more or less in real time.  To that end, while you're coding, I will ask you to check things into a Github repository; I'll be checking them out so we can discuss them remotely.

Git is a little complicated but extremely valuable to know.  Please read the intro to Git at [[git.md]].  I am a committed but fairly-shallowly-experienced Git user, but I think we can work through any major problems.

## Slack
I will set up Slack, a text-based chat-channel service you are probably already using for something else.  Look for an invitation in your email.

## Zoom
We will run the voice/video part of the call in my personal Zoom room.  The link is on Canvas.  I'll log in and host TTh 1:00 just like the usual class time.
