<p>#All About git (OK, a little about git) Git is basically the modern standard system for /version control/. What is easiest to explain about version control is what it isn’t: it isn’t “I wrote some code and saved it as mycode.C. I emailed that to my colleague who edited it and saved mycode-Edited.C. I found a bug in that so I emailed her back mycode-Edited-Fixed.C. But she had been fixing another bug in the meantime and had to find my edits to merge mycode-Edited.C (her version) with mycode-Edited-Fixed.C (my version).” Nor is it like a Google Doc: “Here is the only copy of the document. I edited it, then you edited it, then I edited it. Shoot, three edits ago I accidentally deleted the intro, can you roll it back? Wait, don’t roll it back, we’d lose the last big edit.”</p>
<p>Instead, Git puts your project under version control. As you edit your documents, it keeps a record of what changes were made in which order. At any time, it can spit back a copy of the document with any requested chain of changes—even if that’s not the order you made the changes in. “Bob took mycode.C and made Edit-A and Edit-B to the first subroutine. At the same time Alice had mycode.C and was making Edit-C to the second subroutine. Git, please show the current master copy as if Edits A, B, and C had all been made.”</p>
<p>The idea is that git allows one or many people to edit a common project, and allow a single working version—or indeed multiple working versions—of the project to “exist”. I will try to show in a few examples why you want to do that.</p>
<p>Open up a terminal (note: there are ways to do this within, e.g., Emacs, or XCode, but I only know the command line version myself.) and start typing. Let’s pretend we are going to simulate a planet’s orbit using Newton’s laws. I will type this stuff in and make obvious coding errors for the sake of showing some of the versioning issues.</p>
<p>Create a directory for your project. Change to that directory.</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir orbitsim
$ cd orbitsim</code></pre>
<p>Make a new file using your preferred text editor and save it.</p>
<pre><code>$ emacs newton.py</code></pre>
<p>Just to make things clearer later, let’s look at that file:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat newton.py

import numpy as np
def force(r1,r2):  the reader will notice there are mistakes in this code
return -Gnewton\*m1\*m2/(r1-r2)\*\*2
</code></pre>
